      <h3>An Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minecraft. A simplistic game, consisting of placing blocks down, breaking blocks, and letting your creativity flow. If yo have played before, you may have noticed some small details that tell a story, lore, if you will. For example, broken nether portals are scattered around the world, hinting that there were people before you who went to the hellish place centuries ago. But if you have been playing for a while, you may have noticed one hidden detail that is always right in front of your nose, and most of the time can go undesovered. This is the story of the crafting table, the furnace, and the dark lives they lead.
        </p>

        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now of course, there are a few things you would need to know in order to understand any of this...
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Main Idea...
              <ol>
                <li>Have you played survivial before?</li>
                <li>How many years have you played?</li>
                <li>Are you familiar with the functions of the crafting table and/or the furnace</li>
                <li>Have you or a loved one suffered from Mesothelioma?</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Essentially Mining </li>
            <li>And crafting</li>
            <li>I'm running out of ideas</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have are familar with the bullet points up top, you know that the crafting table is always placed next to the furnace. You can't have a base without them being there, its just a natural law. Because of this, many people have started to speculacte that they are indeed married and, shockingly enough, have kids as well. The smoker and the blast furnace. The smoker for example is a furnace laced with wood, showing signs that their parents are indeed the surnace and crafting table. However, the blast furnace has a much darker tale. A furnace, laced not with wood, but instead with iron. Crafting table, you are not the father. But who would the furnace cheat on the crafting table with? There is really only one other iteam made with iron. The anvil. Unfortunetly the story doesn't end there. There is one more piece to the puzzle. The grindstone. The grindstone acts similarily to the anvil, but there is one clue that leads us to believe something smells sussy. <small>again im so sorry</small> The grindstone is laced with wood. With all of these broken shards, we can put a story together that shows us just how dark some minecraft lore can get. 
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crafting table and the furnace were in a loving relationship for a long time, they had a child, the smoker, and another child, the blast furnace. The crafting table noticed that the furnace had started acting strange lately, and the crafting table was already suspicious. So the crafting table took a DNA test of blast furnace, and to their horror, found out that the furnace was indeed cheating on them with no other than the anvil. Now, the carfting table and the anvil went way back. They had both been friends even before the crafting table met the furnace, but had lost contact since their marriage In a rage, the crafting table went straight to the anvil and confronted the anvil. The anvil was mortified. The anvil said that the furnace had told them that the crafting table and the furnace had divorced years ago. The anvil comforted the crafting table over the months that the crafting table spent on the paperwork of actually divorcing the furnace. The furnace begged the  crafting table to stay, but it was to no avail. Eventually the crafting table and the anvil became closer and closer until one day they married, and had the grindstone as a child. However, the furnace could never let the past go and began to continuously stalk the crafting table. To this day, the furnace is still placed next to the crafting table because the furnace cannot let the past go, and the anvil and crafting table are in a healthy relationship. <br><small>and once again, i am sincerley sorry</small>
